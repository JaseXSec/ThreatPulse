## Geolocation & Threat Attribution

### IP Geolocation Features
- **Geographic location**: City, region, country
- **Network information**: ISP, organization, ASN
- **Coordinates**: Latitude/longitude for mapping
- **Timezone**: Local time zone information

### Threat Attribution Logic
ThreatPulse maps threat origins to known threat actors:

- **Russia**: APT28, APT29, Turla, Sandworm
- **China**: APT1, APT40, APT41, Lazarus  
- **North Korea**: Lazarus, APT38, Kimsuky
- **Iran**: APT33, APT34, APT35, MuddyWater
- **Hosting Providers**: Marked as "Compromised Infrastructure"
- **Unknown/Other**: Labeled as "Unattributed"

## Configuration

### Auto-Refresh Interval
Modify the refresh interval in the `init_scheduler()` function:

```python
scheduler.add_job(
    func=update_threat_data,
    trigger="interval",
    minutes=15,  # Change this value (1-60 minutes recommended)
    id='threat_update'
)
```

### Port Configuration
To run on a different port, modify the last line in `threatpulse.py`:

```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=False, threaded=True)
```

### Geolocation Service
ThreatPulse uses `ip-api.com` for free geolocation. No API key required, but has rate limits (45 requests/minute). The service can be changed in the `GeoLocationService` class.

## API Endpoints

ThreatPulse provides REST APIs for integration:

### Get All Threat Data
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/threats
```

Returns complete threat data including geolocation and attribution.

### Force Refresh Data
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/refresh
```

Triggers immediate data collection from all sources.

### Response Format
```json
{
  "last_update": "2025-01-20T10:30:00",
  "malicious_ips": [
    {
      "ip": "192.168.1.100",
      "source": "DShield", 
      "geolocation": {
        "country": "United States",
        "city": "New York",
        "organization": "Digital Ocean"
      },
      "threat_attribution": "Compromised Infrastructure"
    }
  ],
  "phishing_urls": [...],
  "malware_hashes": [...],
  "sources": [...]
}
```

## Security Considerations

- **No Authentication Required**: All threat feeds are public
- **Read-Only Access**: ThreatPulse only consumes data, never submits
- **Data Sanitization**: All external data is validated before display
- **Local Processing**: No data is sent to external services except for geolocation
- **HTTPS Connections**: All API calls use secure connections
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects API rate limits and includes fallbacks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Kill process using port 5000 (PowerShell)
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5000).OwningProcess | Stop-Process
# Or run on different port (edit threatpulse.py)
```

**Performance Tips**
- All sources are now optimized and working - no performance issues expected
- Initial load takes ~15-20 seconds - this is normal for geolocation processing
- Dashboard refreshes every 15 minutes automatically
- Use `python threatpulse.py --test-geo` to verify geolocation functionality

**Dependencies Installation Issues**
```bash
# Manual installation if auto-install fails
pip install Flask==3.0.0 requests==2.31.0 APScheduler==3.10.4
```

### System Requirements
- **Minimum**: Python 3.7+, 100MB RAM, internet connection
- **Recommended**: Python 3.8+, 256MB RAM for optimal performance
- **Network**: Requires access to threat intelligence APIs (all public, no auth required)

### Monitoring & Logs
- Application provides detailed logging of all threat collection activities
- Success/failure status for each source visible in dashboard
- Real-time countdown shows next refresh timing
- All sources currently show "SUCCESS" status consistently
